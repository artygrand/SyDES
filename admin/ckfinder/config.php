ResourceType : defines the "resource types" handled in CKFinder. A resource
type is nothing more than a way to group files under different paths, each one
having different configuration settings.

Each resource type name must be unique.

When loading CKFinder, the "type" querystring parameter can be used to display
a specific type only. If "type" is omitted in the URL, the
"DefaultResourceTypes" settings is used (may contain the resource type names
separated by a comma). If left empty, all types are loaded.

maxSize is defined in bytes, but shorthand notation may be also used.
Available options are: G, M, K (case insensitive).
1M equals 1048576 bytes (one Megabyte), 1K equals 1024 bytes (one Kilobyte), 1G equals one Gigabyte.
Example: 'maxSize' => "8M",

 Due to security issues with Apache modules, it is recommended to leave the
 following setting enabled.

 How does it work? Suppose the following:

	- If "php" is on the denied extensions list, a file named foo.php cannot be
	  uploaded.
	- If "rar" (or any other) extension is allowed, one can upload a file named
	  foo.rar.
	- The file foo.php.rar has "rar" extension so, in theory, it can be also
	  uploaded.

In some conditions Apache can treat the foo.php.rar file just like any PHP
script and execute it.

If CheckDoubleExtension is enabled, each part of the file name after a dot is
checked, not only the last part. In this way, uploading foo.php.rar would be
denied, because "php" is on the denied extensions list.
